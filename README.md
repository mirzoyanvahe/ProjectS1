## Introduction

The Machine Health Monitoring System is designed to provide a comprehensive view of industrial machine health through a combination of an event generator and a machine details reader. The event generator simulates dynamic health events, while the machine details reader allows users to customize monitoring settings for each machine.

## Features

- Random generation of health-related events (e.g., module alarms, temperature alerts) for industrial machines.
- Personalized machine monitoring through the customization of details for each machine.
- Real-time data collection and analysis to support proactive maintenance strategies.
- Versatile and platform-independent design.

## Getting Started
